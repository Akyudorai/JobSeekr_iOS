# Job Seekr

## Purpose of the App
The designated app for ths project will be a job application system that allows ease of access to the job application process as well as the hiring process.  Inspired by the functionality of Tinder and Linkedin, the application features a server-based database that stores information on user accounts and job opportunities.  

The app will be divided into two separate applications: a front-end application for the mobile device and a java application for depositing job opportunities into the database.

The front-end application will feature a simple layout that allows the user to create an account, log-in, edit their profile information, and apply to jobs from a remote location using an internet connection.  The user will first be greated by a log-in page when launching the application, to which they have the choice of attempting to log-in with a pair of account credientials, or create a new account if they don't already have one.  Creating an account directly deposits their account information into the database with default information for their profile.  After logging in, the user will be introduced to the application page, which will display a navigatable list of job opportunities.  The user can scroll through them and press the apply button at the bottom of the screen to send their profile information to the owner of the job application.  The user can press the profile button at the top of the phone to see their current profile information, and update the information pressing the settings button.  

The back-end application for posting job opportunities is intended to be a tool for job posters to have an easy way of depositing job opportunities without having to directly access the database, similarly to how the the user of the application creates an account.  The general idea is to reduce the difficulty and increase the ease of access to the whole process of posting jobs.

## Value of the App
Two parties benefit from the use of this application.  Firstly, the job seeker will benefit from it by significantly by providing a simpler way of sending out their portfolio and resumes with no delay.  The job seeker will also benefit from the one-time setup of the app, which allows them to avoid having to fill out all their information on each and every online job application, as the information is stored on the server and sent out based on the users app inputs.  

The second party to benefit from the application will be the business owners that are using the app.  The application will assist employees in managing their employment process by reducing the number of locations necessary to navigate down to a single location.  Additionally, the application should be designed to filter out weak candidates from strong candidates to increase the likelihood of hiring the right employee the first time.  

## Typical Usage
### Customer-Use
The user, after opening the application, will be greeted with a log-in page to which they can either attempt to log in or create an account.  If the user doesn't have an account, they will be required to do so before accessing the rest of the application.  After logging in, they will be greeted with the job swiping page, which they can navigate through to apply to jobs.  The user can also move to their profile to see their current information and edit it with the settings menu.

### Business-Use
The business will only have the requirement of establishing a "business" account with the owner of the project, which will grant them access to the ability to post job openings using the back-end java application.  Once the business has posted jobs, they will begin to receive email notifications via the app that will be directed towards whatever email the business requests.  From this point, the applications will be sorted into a numbered order from most-suitable to least-suitable depending on the skills and information of the users profile and linkedin.
