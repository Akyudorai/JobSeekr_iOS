# Queue-Reservation-System

## Purpose of the App
The designated app for ths project will be a queue reservation system that allows users to connect from an app on their phone and reserve a position in a database.  The intention is to develop an application that will aid businesses by offering a reservation system for their business, so as to avoid congestion within the establishment.  The concept will be based off the Skip the Dishes application from my time working in the restaurant industry.

The app will be divided into two separate applications: a customer-use app and a business-use app.

The customer-use application will feature a simple layout that allows the user to input their data and place a reservation from a remote location using an internet connection.  Once a reservation is placed, the customer will be placed in a queue and will be displayed information regarding their position in that queue, as well as the approximate wait time.  The business-use application will offer a primary view that allows the employees to managge their reservation system, including the number of customers in the queue, the order in which they were placed, the customers' information, and options to complete or remove a reservation from a list.  The business-use application will also feature the option to access the database and review their customer history.

## Value of the App
Two parties benefit from the use of this application.  Firstly, the customer will benefit from it by significantly reducing their wait times.  The customer will be able to view what their position in the queue is and the approximate wait time until their position is next in line.  The customer can place their reservation from home and arrive on site at the same time or shortly before their reservation expires in order to avoid wait times.  

The second party to benefit from the application will be the business owners that are using the app.  The application will assist employees in managing their customers and will offer ease of access to the history of customers.  The app will also assist the business by reducing the level of congestion within the store, as well as increasing the number of potential customers.

## Typical Usage
### Customer-Use
The user, after opening the application, will be greeted with a single view that displays how many people are currently in the queue and the option to place a reservation via a button.  Upon clicking the button, a display will pop-up prompting the user to input their information, such as their name, phone number, and reason for reservation.  Once the information slots have been filled, they can finish by pressing a "place reservation" button, which will close the pop-up display and ping the server, placing their information in the database.  The customer will return to the first screen they saw upon opening the app, and it will now display their current position in the queue, the approximate time until they should arrive at the business, the number of customers ahead of them in line, and an option to cancel their reservation at any time. 

### Business-Use
The business will run this application during work hours.  The employees have the option of reviewing the history of customer information or waiting until a new reservation arrives.  Once a new reservation is placed, the employee can press on the reservation to review the customer information.  The employee also has the option of cancelling a reservation, should the customer not arrive, and the option of completing a reservation in the case of a successful transaction.  Finally, the business-app will have an options menu that allows the employees to adjust the settings for the estimated wait times for all customer apps.  These settings will be managed by the number of employees that are currently working at the establishment and the approximate time to complete each task.

## Additional Features
These include ideas to implement after achieving the minimum viable product for this project: transaction system for automatic payment, a database featuring what the business can do and the option for customers to reference other work (i.e. a photo gallery of hair styles for a barbershop that a customer can scroll through while waiting, and can be shown to the employee upon arrival). 

As more ideas come to mind, they will be noted here.
